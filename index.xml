      <description>My name is Cody Zanga and I&amp;rsquo;m currently a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I&amp;rsquo;ll be graduating this fall with a major in sports media and communication with a minor in statistics.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Renton, Wash. and grew up a fan of all the Seattle sports teams. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with looking at statistics in sports ever since I was a kid. I plan on analyzing data on all sorts of different sports and teams, but especially my Seattle Mariners.</description>

      <description>Fans of the Seattle Mariners have had to face more consistent ineptitude than almost any other professional team in American sports. For a team that has been around since 1977 to only have four playoff appearances is unacceptable. Currently, the last playoff appearance for the Mariner’s was in 2001, which was 21-years-ago. With that said, the Mariner’s are the proud owners of the longest playoff drought in American sports, but last season there was a glimmer of hope.</description>
