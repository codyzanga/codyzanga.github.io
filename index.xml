      <description>For those who don’t follow sports or baseball closely, the Seattle Mariners held the longest playoff drought across all professional North American sports teams. Coming into 2022, the drought had reached 20 years having last made the playoffs during a historic 2001 season that saw the team win 116 games.
Using data gathered from Baseball Reference, we’re going to take a look at how the Mariners ended the drought in 2022.</description>

      <title>Bad umpire calls in MLB.</title>

      <description>Umpires making bad calls is nothing new to baseball. Nearly every game there’s balls called strikes and strikes called balls, but how much impact does this really have on the outcome of every game that’s played throughout a regular MLB season? Fans of baseball no doubt can bring up moments where they feel like an entire at-bat is changed due to a bad call or even the outcome of the game has been shifted.</description>

      <title>Is winning games connected to passer rating?</title>

      <description>For a while now it seems that there has been a lot of debate on how important passer rating really is for an NFL quarterback. There are other complex statistics out there such as QBR, which was created by ESPN to be a more accurate method to assess QB performance. QBR measures nearly everything a QB does including their turnovers, penalties and their performance compared to the rest of their team.</description>

      <description>My name is Cody Zanga and I&amp;rsquo;m currently a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I&amp;rsquo;ll be graduating this fall with a major in sports media and communication with a minor in statistics.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Renton, Wash. and grew up a fan of all the Seattle sports teams. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with looking at statistics in sports ever since I was a kid. I plan on analyzing data on all sorts of different sports and teams, but especially my Seattle Mariners.</description>

      <title>Were the 2021 Mariners lucky, good or both?</title>

      <description>Fans of the Seattle Mariners have had to face more consistent ineptitude than almost any other professional team in American sports. For a team that has been around since 1977 to only have four playoff appearances is unacceptable. Currently, the last playoff appearance for the Mariners was in 2001, which was 21-years-ago. With that said, the Mariners are the proud owners of the longest playoff drought in American sports, but last season there was a glimmer of hope.</description>
